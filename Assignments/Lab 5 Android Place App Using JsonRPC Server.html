<p><b><font size="+1">Description</font></b>
</p><p>
Create an <b>Android</b> app to browse and modify a collection of <b>Place Descriptions</b>,
as you did in prior assignments. But, for this app, make network connections to a JsonRPC server to provide
the model for your app, instead of storing the model on the device itself. Your app should
provide the ability to browse, add, and remove places. Any changes to places or the library that are made
by the app user should be pushed to the server using the JsonRPC methods defined by the server.

</p><p>
You may use the instructor provided <b>JsonRPC</b> server for places
to implement your Android app:
<a href="http://pooh.poly.asu.edu/Mobile/Assigns/Assign5/placeServerWeb.jar" target="_blank">
placeServerWeb.jar</a>, or you may build your own server based on the student collection example
discussed in class, and linked below.
      </p><ul>
        <li><a href="http://pooh.poly.asu.edu/Mobile/Examples/studentCollectionJsonRPCServer.jar">
      studentCollectionJsonRPCServer.jar</a> JsonRPC student collection server.</li>
       <li><a href="http://pooh.poly.asu.edu/Mobile/Examples/Unit06-JsonRPC-AndroidNetworking/studentJsonRPCClientViaAsyncTask.jar">
      studentJsonRPCClientViaAsyncTask.jar</a> JsonRPC client using <b>AsyncTask</b>.</li>
       <li><a href="http://pooh.poly.asu.edu/Mobile/Examples/Unit06-JsonRPC-AndroidNetworking/studentJsonRPCClientViaThread.jar">
       studentJsonRPCClientViaThread.jar</a> JsonRPC client using Thread/Handler.</li>
       </ul>
<p>
Please refer to the <b>readme.txt</b> file in the instructor's place server, and in the student collection
server for instructions for executing these servers.

</p><p>
Use the <b>Place Collection JsonRPC</b> server, to create
an Android App, based on your solution to
       <a href="http://pooh.poly.asu.edu/Mobile/Assigns/Assign3/assign3.html">
       Lab3: Android App to View and Manage PlaceDescriptions</a>.
Your Android app should use the server as its only data source for obtaining
place information. You should not retain a local mirror of the collection within the
app, and instead use the <b>JsonRPC</b> methods defined by your collection to obtain
model information. You may however find that you need to create a local array of place names
to supply information to an adapter.
</p><p>
       Your app should not perform network connections on the UI or Main Thread, but instead should
       perform these operations asynchronously. Your app should also not access view objects except on the
       UI or Main Thread.
       You are free to use either the <b>Thread and Handler</b> approach
       or <b>AsyncTask</b> approach to adhere to this constraint.
       Both approaches are shown in student collection examples linked above.
</p><p>
The Android app should use an entry in the file: <b>res/values/strings.xml</b> to record the default URL
for android. Since the Android Emulator runs as a virtual machine its <b>IP</b> is not the same as the
host/development machine, as it is with iOS simulator. Instead, your development machine is considered as the
Emulator's gateway. To find this on a device or the emulator, use the Android Debugger from the
command line as:<b></b></p><pre><b>     path_to_sdk/sdk/platform-tools/adb shell
</b>This will remotely log you onto the Emulator. Then enter the following commands to find ip's:<b>
     ip addr show
     ip route show
</b></pre>
Use the default gateway ip, which is: <b>10.0.2.2</b>.
So, your default url for the the Android app will be:<center><pre><b>
http://10.0.2.2:8080/
</b></pre></center>
<p>
The same packaging, documentation and solution formatting constraints as with the
prior assignments apply to this assignment as well.
</p><ol>
  <li>Place all of your application source code into the package named:
  <b>edu.asu.bsse.asuriteid.appname</b>
  <br>where <b>bsse</b> designates your academic program:
  <b>bscse</b>, <b>msse</b>, <b>bsse</b>, <b>bscs</b>, which stand for
  <b>BS Computer Systems Engineering</b>, <b>MS Software Engineering</b>, <b>BS Software Engineering</b>,
  or <b>BS Computer Science</b> respectively. <br><b>asuriteid</b> is your asurite id.</li>
  <li>As part of all class header comments, that you create and turn-in this semester,
  include a copyright notice, such as:
  <b>Copyright 2018 Your Name</b>.</li>
  <li>As part of the class header comments, include a <b>right to use</b> statement.
  The examples presented in class use the Apache License Version 2, but you should put
  whatever rights you prefer. At the very least, you must provide the instuctor and
  the University with the right to build and evaluate
  the software package for the purpose of determining your grade and program assessment.</li>
  <li>As part of the class header comments, include a reference to the software's author, such as:<br>
  <b>@author &nbsp;&nbsp;FirstName LastName&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mailto:FirstName.LastName@asu.edu</b>.</li>
  <li>As part of the class header comments, include an indication of the software version, such as:<br>
  <b>@version January 2, 2018</b></li>
</ol>
These comments are required on all code that you generate this semester. If you hand in an
assigment that does not include them, it will not be graded.

<p><b><font size="+1">What To Hand-In</font></b>
</p><p>
Structure your project as sub-directories of the folder named
<b>Assign5MyASURITEID</b>.
Use the same folder structure as used in the student collection example linked above.
The sub-directories should contain the <b>Android app, and server</b>. If you use the instructor's
server, you do not need to submit it, providing you adhere to the Json formats used by those servers.
</p><p>
You will submit this project, by first cleaning it to remove all generated files.
Then create a <b>jar</b> or <b>zip</b> archive of the project (Assign5*) directory.
You can create a <b>Java Archive (jar)</b> by executing the following command from
a terminal in the directory which is parent to the project directory:<br><br>
<b>jar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-cvf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assign5MyASURITEID.jar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assign5MyASURITEID/</b><br><br>
That archive will then be submitted via
<b>Blackboard</b>.
</p><p><b><font size="+1">Grading Criteria</font></b>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
  <li><b>7 points</b>. Your app should define and properly use network requests off of the
  UI/Main Thread by using either the AsyncTask or Thread and Handler.
  </li>
  <li><b>5 points</b>. Your Android app (and server, if appropriate) solution includes
  comments described above as headers for each class used in the app.
  </li><li><b>8 points</b>. Your Android app provides the ability to list all place names, to display
  the details of a single place, and to manually add and remove place descriptions. Your app uses only
  the <b>JsonRPC</b> server as its underlying model, with the exception noted above.
  </li>
