<p><b><font size="+1">Description</font></b>
</p><p>
You are again to construct both an Android and iOS app. These apps should demonstrate
lifecycles on these platforms. Here is a description of the two apps.
</p><p><b><font size="+1">Android</font></b>
</p><p>
In the Android app, create a two activity app. One activity is the <b>MainActivity</b> and the
other is a <b>manually</b> created alert Activity (<b>AlertActivity</b>, as demonstrated in class,
start the second activity upon a button click in the first view.
Both activities should
override the following activity lifecycle methods: <b>onRestart, onStart, onResume, onPause,
onStop,</b> and <b>onDestroy</b>. The only actions in each of these methods are to
call the parent's corresponding (overridden) method, and to log the name of
the class and the name of the method being called. That is, call<br><b>
android.util.Log.w</b><br>
passing the string name of the class (<b>this.getClass().getSimpleName()</b>) and the string name
of the method.
</p><p>
Get each life-cycle method to be called. Using comments before each method, explain what you had
to do to get the method to be called.
</p><p>
The <b>MainActivity</b> and its corresponding view (<b>layout/activity_main.xml</b> should include
a <b>button</b> and a simple message. When the button is clicked, create a new <b>Intent</b> for the
<b>AlertActivity</b> and start the activity associated with the intent. The <b>AlertActivity</b>
should only take up a portion of the screen (about a third) and include a message, such as
"Hello Android Developer", and a <b>Button</b> labelled <b>OK</b>. Clicking the <b>OK</b> button
should cause the <b>AlertActivity</b> to <b>finish</b>.
</p><p><b><font size="+1">iOS</font></b>
</p><p>
In the iOS app, do not implement the same functionality as you did for Android.
Instead, log all of the <b>AppDelegate</b> lifecycle methods. Use the <b>NSLog</b> or the
<b>print</b> method.
These provide the opportunity for the app developer to react to any state changes in the
app from a single place in the app's code.
All of these methods have empty implementations in the
<b>Single View Application</b> template. You should provide a log that names the method
that has been called. Explore with the App and the Simulator to discover how to get all of
the six methods to be called and generate a log that displays in <b>Xcode</b>.
</p><p>
Also implement a simple two <b>view iOS</b> app that demonstrates each of the optional
lifecycle methods in <b>UIViewController</b>:
</p><ul>
  <li><b>override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool)</b></li>
  <li><b>override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool)</b></li>
  <li><b>override func viewWillDisappear(_ animated: Bool)</b></li>
  <li><b>override func viewDidDisappear(_ animated: Bool)</b></li>
</ul>
For both <b>Android</b> and <b>iOS</b>, implement these methods to create a log entry
(<b>NSLog</b> or the <b>print</b> method) that identifies the view controller and method
that's been called. In comments before the method implementation, indicate what you had
to do to get the system to call the method, thus generating a log entry.
<p>
Same as with the Android app, get each life-cycle (state transition) method to be called.
Using comments before each method, explain what you had
to do to get the method to be called.
Augment the template comments in the app delegate methods with a description of what
you had to do on the <b>Simulator/Xcode</b> to get the message to display in the <b>Xcode</b>
log.
</p><p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Place all of your application source code into the package named:
  <b>edu.asu.bsse.asuriteid.appname</b>
  <br>where <b>bsse</b> designates your academic program:
  <b>bscse</b>, <b>msse</b>, <b>bsse</b>, <b>bscs</b>, which stand for
  <b>BS Computer Systems Engineering</b>, <b>MS Software Engineering</b>, <b>BS Software Engineering</b>,
  or <b>BS Computer Science</b> respectively. <br><b>asuriteid</b> is your asurite id.</li>
  <li>As part of all class header comments, that you create and turn-in this semester,
  include a copyright notice, such as:
  <b>Copyright 2017 Your Name</b>.</li>
  <li>As part of the class header comments, include a <b>right to use</b> statement.
  The examples presented in class use the Apache License Version 2, but you should put
  whatever rights you prefer. At the very least, you must provide the instuctor and
  the University with the right to build and evaluate
  the software package for the purpose of determining your grade and program assessment.</li>
  <li>As part of the class header comments, include a reference to the software's author, such as:<br>
  <b>@author &nbsp;&nbsp;FirstName LastName&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mailto:FirstName.LastName@asu.edu</b>.</li>
  <li>As part of the class header comments, include an indication of the software version, such as:<br>
  <b>@version March 2, 2017</b></li>
</ol>
These comments are required on all code that you generate this semester. If you hand in an
assigment that does not include them, it will not be graded.
Here are the <b>StudentJson</b> classes that were constructed during the first class session
as part of the example <b>Android</b> and <b>iOS</b> apps. See:
<a href="http://pooh.poly.asu.edu/Mobile/Assigns/Assign1/studentJsonClasses.jar" target="_blank">studentJsonClasses.jar</a>. Use java's
<b>jar</b> command to extract this file. It will create a folder containing a <b>playground</b>
that can be opened in <b>Xcode</b> and a <b>Java</b> class in the file <b>StudentJson.java</b>.
<p><b><font size="+1">What To Hand-In</font></b>
</p><p>
The posted quiz does not need to be submitted this week, and should be used as
a study guide.
</p><p>
Structure your project as two sub-directories of the folder named <b>Assign2MyASURITEID</b>.
One sub-directory for the <b>iOS</b> app and the other for the <b>Android</b> app.
You will submit this project, by first cleaning it (to remove all generated files.
Then create a <b>jar</b> or <b>zip</b> archive of the project (Assign2*) directory.
You can create a <b>Java Archive (jar)</b> by executing the following command from
a terminal in the directory which is parent to the project directory:<br><br>
<b>jar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-cvf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assign2MyASURITEID.jar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assign2MyASURITEID/</b><br><br>
That archive will then be submitted via
<b>Blackboard</b>. See the Content section.
</p><p><b><font size="+1">Grading Criteria</font></b>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
  <li><b>5 points</b>. Your solutions build using Xcode and Android Studio. And, your
  UI's appear properly in the simulator with an <b>iPhone 6</b> and
  Android emulator with a <b>Nexus5-API23</b>.
  </li>
  <li><b>5 points</b>. Your Android app should define and properly use an <b>alert</b> dialog.
  Your Android solution generates log messages that demonstrate the app/view lifecycle
  activities outlined above and in class.
  </li>
  <li><b>5 points</b>. Your solution (both apps) includes comments described above as headers for each
  class used in the apps.
  </li><li><b>5 points</b>. Your iOS app should include a log in each AppDelegate lifecycle method,
  and it should include comments indicating how to get the method to execute on the Simulator.
  </li>
