<p><b><font size="+1">Description</font></b>
</p><p>
Recast your Android Place Library app to work with a <b>SQLite</b> database as its underlying model.
Your app should include a minimal database in the app bundle, which is used
to initialize the app's database should it not already exist in internal
storage. Your app should provide the ability to add new place descriptions,
to remove place descriptions, and to modify existing place descriptions.
Include the same place fields/properties as defined in prior assignments:
See: <a href="http://pooh.poly.asu.edu/Mobile/Assigns/Assign1/assign1.html" target="_blank">Single View Place Places (Android part Only)</a>, and
<a href="http://pooh.poly.asu.edu/Mobile/Assigns/Assign3/assign3.html" target="_blank">Multi-View Place Manager</a>.
</p><p>
</p><p><b><font size="+1">What To Hand-In</font></b>
</p><p>
The same packaging, documentation and solution formatting constraints as with the
prior assignments apply to this assignment as well.
</p><ol>
  <li>Place all of your application source code into the package named:
  <b>edu.asu.bsse.asuriteid.appname</b>
  <br>where <b>bsse</b> designates your academic program:
  <b>bscse</b>, <b>msse</b>, <b>bsse</b>, <b>bscs</b>, which stand for
  <b>BS Computer Systems Engineering</b>, <b>MS Software Engineering</b>, <b>BS Software Engineering</b>,
  or <b>BS Computer Science</b> respectively. <br><b>asuriteid</b> is your asurite id.</li>
  <li>As part of all class header comments, that you create and turn-in this semester,
  include a copyright notice, such as:
  <b>Copyright 2016 Your Name</b>.</li>
  <li>As part of the class header comments, include a <b>right to use</b> statement.
  The examples presented in class use the Apache License Version 2, but you should put
  whatever rights you prefer. At the very least, you must provide the instuctor and
  the University with the right to build and evaluate
  the software package for the purpose of determining your grade and program assessment.</li>
  <li>As part of the class header comments, include a reference to the software's author, such as:<br>
  <b>@author &nbsp;&nbsp;FirstName LastName&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mailto:FirstName.LastName@asu.edu</b>.</li>
  <li>As part of the class header comments, include an indication of the software version, such as:<br>
  <b>@version March 2, 2016</b></li>
</ol>
These comments are required on all code that you generate this semester. If you hand in an
assigment that does not include them, it will not be graded.
<p>
Structure your project as a sub-directory of the folder named
<b>Assign7MyASURITEID</b>.
Use the same folder structure as used in the database example
<a href="http://pooh.poly.asu.edu/Mobile/Examples/Unit08-Android-Sqlite/studentCourseDatabase.jar">studentCourseDatabase.jar</a>.
The sub-directories should separately contain each of the following:
</p><ul>
  <li><b>The Android app, </b>and</li>
  <li><b> The Database Initialization files</b>. These should mirror those in the
  student course database example.</li>
</ul>
You will submit this project, by first cleaning its Android app
to remove all generated files.
Then create a <b>jar</b> or <b>zip</b> archive of the project (Assign7*) directory.
You can create a <b>Java Archive (jar)</b> by executing the following command from
a terminal in the directory which is parent to the project directory:<br><br>
<b>jar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-cvf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assign7MyASURITEID.jar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assign7MyASURITEID/</b><br><br>
That archive will then be submitted via
<b>Blackboard</b>. See the appropriate Week's section.
<p><b><font size="+1">Grading Criteria</font></b>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
  <li><b>8 points</b>. Your database definition and initialization files.
  Your <b>Android</b> app should also define and properly use a
  write-able database that's initialized from the app bundle to access, store, and modify
  place information. Your app uses Sqlite to access this database.
  </li>
  <li><b>2 points</b>. Your app targets API 23 and uses API 23 as the minimum SDK version,
  it uses the current compileSdkVersion (26). These will assure it builds and runs on
  the grader's Android Studio (version 3) configuration. It uses the packaging constraints
  defined in the first assignment, linked above.
  </li>
  <li><b>5 points</b>. Your app provides the ability to list and browse all place names,
  to display the details of a selected place description, to add new place descriptions,
  modify existing place descriptions, and delete existing place descriptions.
  </li>
  <li><b>5 points</b>. Your app provides the capabilty for the user to view the
  great circle distance and initial heading between any two registered places as
  selected by the user.</li>
