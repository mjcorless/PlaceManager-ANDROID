You are to construct a single view (scene) app for <b>Swift/iOS</b> and another for
<b>Java/Android</b> to display <b>Place</b> information as described below.
This assignment, and some others this semester build on <b>Geocoding Services</b>, such
as those provided by:
<a href="https://geoservices.tamu.edu/Services/Geocode/" target="_blank">Texas A&amp;M Geoservices</a>.
These are common services utilized by many mobile and web apps where mapping and geo-location
is required. You will not be required to subscribe to any <b>Geocoding Services</b> to complete this
or other assignments this semester. In this app, you will be defining a class for a
<b>place description</b>. In future apps, we'll create an underlying model for apps that
use places, and explore different approaches for representing this model.
We will look at multi-view apps, navigation among views, databases, networking, mapping,
and location services, for example.
</p><p>
Both of the apps you devleop for this assignmet should display the information of a
<b>PlaceDescription</b> as will fit in a single view. Both should be single-view apps.
For our purposes a place is a simplified holder for information about geographic places
of interest, such as a waypoint, and includes at least the following information:
</p><ul>
  <li><b>Name</b>. A simple string, which is unique among all names of places for this user. Usually
  one or two words.</li>
  <li><b>Description</b>. Text providing descriptive information about the place.</li>
  <li><b>Category</b>. Text describing the type of place this entry describes. Sample categories are
  <b>residence</b>, <b>travel</b>, and <b>hike</b>.</li>
  <li><b>Address Title</b>. This field is equivalent to the first line that would appear in an address,
  sometimes called the <b>recipient line</b>. It indicates the individual or organization to which the
  address pertains. This field is generally not used in a geocoding lookup.</li>
  <li><b>Address Street, City, State, Country, Zip Code</b>. The rest of an address. This includes the street
  address, city or town, the state and optionally country and/or zip code. Although the examples indicate
  otherwise, you may assume <b>USA</b> address format only.</li>
  <li><b>elevation</b>. Feet mean sea level elevation of the place. This field is also generally not used
  in geocoding services, but is useful in route planning.</li>
  <li><b>latitude</b>. Degrees latitude, using a single double value to represent. Lines of equal latitude
  run parallel to the Equator. Values range from
  -90.0 to +90.0. Negative values refer to the southern hemisphere and positive values to the northern
  hemisphere.</li>
  <li><b>longitude</b>. Degrees of longitude, using a single double value. Values range from -180.0 to +180.0.
  Lines of equal longitude run perpendicular to the Equator. Negative values increase west from the Prime
  Meridian, which is longitude 0.0 and is located in Greenwich England. Positive values increase east from
  the Prime Meridian. 180.0 (plus and minus) is the International Date Line.</li>
  <li><b>Example</b>. Here is an example <b>Place Description</b> represented in <b>Json</b>:
  <pre>  {
    "name" : "ASU-Poly",
    "description" : "Home of ASU's Software Engineering Programs",
    "category" : "School",
    "address-title" : "ASU Software Engineering",
    "address-street" : "7171 E Sonoran Arroyo Mall\nPeralta Hall 230\nMesa AZ 85212",
    "elevation" : 1384.0,
    "latitude" : 33.306388,
    "longitude" : -111.679121
  }
  </pre></li>
</ul>
You are to construct a <b>PlaceDescription</b> class for each app.
<b>PlaceDescription</b> is a container for the information described above.
Through properties, methods, or visibility controls,
provide that users of the class may access and set values of each field. 
<p>
In future assignments, your class should provide the ability to calculate the
<b>great-circle spherical distance</b> between two <b>Place Description</b>s,
as well as an <b>initial heading</b>. You can use the following
references (or any others you find) to see how to calculate these values using available math packages. See: 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance" target="_blank">Wikipedia Great Circle Distance</a>
And, another reference which expresses the same in <b>javascript</b>:
<a href="http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html" target="_blank">Java Script Calculations</a>
You should understand the difference between <b>Great Circle</b> and <b>Rhumb-line</b> distances.
One reference showing the difference is: 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhumb_line" target="_blank">Wikipedia Rhumb Line</a>.
</p><p>
These assignments also require your <b>Place Description</b> to serialize to and from
a <b>Json</b> representation. You should build that into your class definition to aid
in initializing a place description object for display in your app.
</p><p>
To do so, your class would include a constructor that builds a <b>PlaceDescription</b> object from
a string of the <b>Json</b> form shown above.
You may also want to include a <b>toJsonString</b> method that returns a string of the <b>Json</b> in the same
format.
</p><p>
Your app should have a single view, and in that view display the fields referenced above on a single screen.
</p><p>
<b>Make the following additions to the app demonstrated</b>.
</p><p>
Your UI should primarily utilize the layouts and simple widgets introduced in the class,
and you may form it based on the example given in class (or Unit 1 first app videos).
Your solutions should follow the documentation and packaging constraints outlined below.
</p><p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Place all of your application source code into the package named:
  <b>edu.asu.bsse.asuriteid.appname</b>
  <br>where <b>bsse</b> designates your academic program:
  <b>bscse</b>, <b>msse</b>, <b>bsse</b>, <b>bscs</b>, which stand for
  <b>BS Computer Systems Engineering</b>, <b>MS Software Engineering</b>, <b>BS Software Engineering</b>,
  or <b>BS Computer Science</b> respectively. <br><b>asuriteid</b> is your asurite id.</li>
  <li>As part of all class header comments, that you create and turn-in this semester,
  include a copyright notice, such as:
  <b>Copyright 2018 Your Name</b>.</li>
  <li>As part of the class header comments, include a <b>right to use</b> statement.
  The examples presented in class use the Apache License Version 2, but you should put
  whatever rights you prefer. At the very least, you must provide the instuctor and
  the University with the right to build and evaluate
  the software package for the purpose of determining your grade and program assessment.</li>
  <li>As part of the class header comments, include a reference to the software's author, such as:<br>
  <b>@author &nbsp;&nbsp;FirstName LastName&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mailto:FirstName.LastName@asu.edu</b>.</li>
  <li>As part of the class header comments, include an indication of the software version, such as:<br>
  <b>@version March 2, 2018</b></li>
</ol>
These comments are required on all code (classes) that you generate this semester. If you hand in an
assigment that does not include them, it will not be graded.
Here are <b>StudentJson</b> classes that demonstrated <b>Json</b> serialization in each language and
platform <b>Android</b> and <b>iOS</b>. See:
<a href="http://pooh.poly.asu.edu/Mobile/Assigns/Assign1/studentJsonClasses.jar" target="_blank">studentJsonClasses.jar</a>. Use java's
<b>jar</b> command to extract this file. It will create a folder containing a <b>playground</b>
that can be opened in <b>Xcode</b> and a <b>Java</b> class in the file <b>StudentJson.java</b>.
<p><b><font size="+1">What To Hand-In</font></b>
</p><p>
The posted quiz does not need to be submitted, and should be used as
a study guide.
</p><p>
Structure your project as two sub-directories of the folder named <b>Assign1MyASURITEID</b>.
One sub-directory for the <b>iOS</b> app and the other for the <b>Android</b> app.
You will submit this project, by first cleaning it (to remove all generated files.
Then create a <b>jar</b> or <b>zip</b> archive of the project (Assign1*) directory.
You can create a <b>Java Archive (jar)</b> by executing the following command from
a terminal in the directory which is parent to the project directory:<br><br>
<b>jar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-cvf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assign1MyASURITEID.jar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assign1MyASURITEID/</b><br><br>
That archive will then be submitted via
<b>Blackboard</b>. See the Content section.
</p><p><b><font size="+1">Grading Criteria</font></b>

</p><ul>
  <li><b>5 points</b>. Your solutions build using Xcode and Android Studio. And, your
  UI's appear properly in the simulator with an <b>iPhone 7</b> and

  to localize the projects to the specified versions of the tools.
