<p><b><font size="+1">Description</font></b>
</p><p>
You are to construct a multiple view iOS app for managing <b>PlaceDescriptions</b>.
The app should be based on the Android app that you developed for Lab3 and your
first lab submission in which you created a <b>Swift</b>.
<b>PlaceDescription</b> class. This app is similar to that one, but uses more
complex controls and multiple views to display and manage a collection of
<b>PlaceDescription</b> objects. Add a <b>PlaceLibrary</b> class which retains
place objects. This app does not need to use the network or access a <b>Place</b> database,
although a future revision of the app will develop these aspects.

Your app should provide a list of all place names contained in the collection.
It should allow the user to select one title and see all of the information about
that title, and it should provide the ability to add or remove place description
entries. New descriptions should be added to the collection
by the user manually entering the appropriate information needed to create a
<b>PlaceDescription</b> object.
Include at least the same properties as were implemented in the first lab.
<a href="http://pooh.poly.asu.edu/Mobile/Assigns/Assign4/places.json">Here</a>
is the instructors json initialization file that my be useful in
creating your solution.

</p><p><b><font size="+1">Constraints</font></b>
</p><p>
In the iOS app adhere to the following constraints:
</p><ol>
  <li>Your app should not be a <b>split-screen</b>, and it should use a <b>Navigation
  Controller</b> to control the navigation bar.
  </li><li>Use a <b>UITableViewController</b> and your storyboard should include a
  <b>Navigation Controller</b>.</li>
  <li>Use at least the following basic controls:
  <b>Button</b>, <b>TextField</b>, and a
  <b>Picker</b>.</li>
  <li>Provides separate classes for <b>PlaceDescription</b> and <b>Place Library</b></li>
</ol>
<p>
The same packaging, documentation and solution formatting constraints as with the
prior assignments apply to this assignment as well:
</p><ol>
  <li>Place all of your application source code into the package named:
  <b>edu.asu.bsse.asuriteid.appname</b>
  <br>where <b>bsse</b> designates your academic program:
  <b>bscse</b>, <b>msse</b>, <b>bsse</b>, <b>bscs</b>, which stand for
  <b>BS Computer Systems Engineering</b>, <b>MS Software Engineering</b>, <b>BS Software Engineering</b>,
  or <b>BS Computer Science</b> respectively. <br><b>asuriteid</b> is your asurite id.</li>
  <li>As part of all class header comments, that you create and turn-in this semester,
  include a copyright notice, such as:
  <b>Copyright 2016 Your Name</b>.</li>
  <li>As part of the class header comments, include a <b>right to use</b> statement.
  The examples presented in class use the Apache License Version 2, but you should put
  whatever rights you prefer. At the very least, you must provide the instuctor and
  the University with the right to build and evaluate
  the software package for the purpose of determining your grade and program assessment.</li>
  <li>As part of the class header comments, include a reference to the software's author, such as:<br>
  <b>@author &nbsp;&nbsp;FirstName LastName&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mailto:FirstName.LastName@asu.edu</b>.</li>
  <li>As part of the class header comments, include an indication of the software version, such as:<br>
  <b>@version March 2, 2016</b></li>
</ol>
These comments are required on all code that you generate this semester. If you hand in an
assigment that does not include them, it will not be graded.

<p><b><font size="+1">What To Hand-In</font></b>
</p><p>
Structure your project as a single sub-directory of the folder named
<b>Assign4MyASURITEID</b>.
The sub-directory should contain the <b>iOS</b> app.
You will submit this project, by first cleaning it (to remove all generated files.
Then create a <b>jar</b> or <b>zip</b> archive of the project (Assign4*) directory.
You can create a <b>Java Archive (jar)</b> by executing the following command from
a terminal in the directory which is parent to the project directory:<br><br>
<b>jar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-cvf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assign4MyASURITEID.jar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assign4MyASURITEID/</b><br><br>
That archive will then be submitted via
<b>Blackboard</b>. See the Content section.
</p><p><b><font size="+1">Grading Criteria</font></b>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
  <li><b>5 points</b>. Your solution builds using Xcode. And, your
  UI appears properly in the simulator with a <b>iPhone 6s</b>.
  </li>
  <li><b>5 points</b>. Your app should define and properly use all <b>all</b>
  of the controls discussed above in the section on <b>Constraints</b>.
  </li>
  <li><b>5 points</b>. Your solution includes comments described above as headers for each
  class used in the apps.
  </li><li><b>5 points</b>. Your app provides the ability to list all place names, to display
  the details of a single place, and to manually add and remove place descriptions.
  </li>
