<h2>Lab 3 Android App to Manage a Library of Place Descriptions</h2>

<h3><font color="#9B0033">Due as described on Blackboard.

<p><b><font size="+1">Description</font></b>
</p><p>
You are to construct a multiple view Android app for managing a collection of <b>Place</b> descriptions.
<b>Place</b> properties were detailed in the first
<a href="http://pooh.poly.asu.edu/Mobile/Assigns/Assign1/assign1.html" target="_blank">Lab Exercise</a>.
The app should be based on the first single view Android app that you developed. Add another
class <b>PlaceLibrary</b> which initializes itself from a <b>json</b> file of places that
are included in the <b>app bundle</b>. Your app should have a single view which lists the names
of all of the Places in your library. Selecting one of the names transitions to a <b>view</b>
which provides the details of the <b>selected</b> place.
Your app should also include the following functionality:
</p><ul>
  <li><b>Add</b> a new place description to the library. The user manually enters all appropriate information.</li>
  <li><b>Modify</b> an existing place description.</li>
  <li><b>Remove</b> an existing entry from the library.</li>
  <li><b>Distance</b> and <b>Initial Bearing</b>. Provide the user the ability to query the
  <b>Great Circle</b> distance (statute miles) and initial <b>bearing</b> from one place
  to any other place in the library.</li>
</ul>
This app is similar to the first, but uses more
complex controls and multiple views to display and manage a collection of
<b>PlaceDescription</b> objects. Add a <b>PlaceLibrary</b> class which retains
place description objects. This app should not need to use the network or a database to
store entries in the <b>PlaceLibrary</b>. These will be added in future Labs. You are not <b>required</b>
to persist any changes made to the <b>PlaceLibrary</b>. You should include a <b>json</b>
file in the app bundle/project for initializing your <b>PlaceLibrary</b>. Create your own, or
use the instructors:
<a href="http://pooh.poly.asu.edu/Mobile/Assigns/Assign3/places.json" target="_blank">places.json
</a>.
<p>
Your app should allow the user to select one place name and see all of the information about
that place, and it should provide the ability to add, change (all but the name), or remove place descriptions.
New descriptions should be added to the collection
by the user manually entering the appropriate information needed to create a
<b>PlaceDescription</b> object. <b>PlaceDescription</b>s should include at least the same properties
as defined in the first <a href="http://pooh.poly.asu.edu/Mobile/Assigns/Assign1/assign1.html" target="_blank">Lab Exercise</a>.
</p><p>
<i><b>Note</b>. Future assignments will utilize and build on this app by exploring
local storage via a database, using the network to get data, synchronizing the two
data storages approaches, and mapping.
</i>
</p><p><b><font size="+1">Constraints</font></b>
</p><p>
In the Android app adhere to the following constraints:
</p><ol>
  <li>Use an <b>Action Bar</b> that includes at least one button whose action relates to
  the requirements of this assignment.</li>
  <li>Use either a <b>ListView</b> or <b>RecyclerView</b> control with a properly
  formed <b>adapter</b>.</li>
  <li>Use at least the following basic controls:
  <b>Button</b>, <b>EditText/TextView</b>, and a
  <b>Picker</b> or <b>Spinner</b>.</li>
  <li>Provide separate classes for a place and for the place library.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The same packaging, documentation and solution formatting constraints as with the
prior assignments apply to this assignment as well:
</p><ol>
  <li>Place all of your application source code into the package named:
  <b>edu.asu.bsse.asuriteid.appname</b>
  <br>where <b>bsse</b> designates your academic program:
  <b>bscse</b>, <b>msse</b>, <b>bsse</b>, <b>bscs</b>, which stand for
  <b>BS Computer Systems Engineering</b>, <b>MS Software Engineering</b>, <b>BS Software Engineering</b>,
  or <b>BS Computer Science</b> respectively. <br><b>asuriteid</b> is your asurite id.</li>
  <li>As part of all class header comments, that you create and turn-in this semester,
  include a copyright notice, such as:
  <b>Copyright 2017 Your Name</b>.</li>
  <li>As part of the class header comments, include a <b>right to use</b> statement.
  The examples presented in class use the Apache License Version 2, but you should put
  whatever rights you prefer. At the very least, you must provide the instuctor and
  the University with the right to build and evaluate
  the software package for the purpose of determining your grade and program assessment.</li>
  <li>As part of the class header comments, include a reference to the software's author, such as:<br>
  <b>@author &nbsp;&nbsp;FirstName LastName&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mailto:FirstName.LastName@asu.edu</b>.</li>
  <li>As part of the class header comments, include an indication of the software version, such as:<br>
  <b>@version March 2, 2017</b></li>
</ol>
These comments are required on all code that you generate this semester. If you hand in an
assigment that does not include them, it will not be graded.

<p><b><font size="+1">What To Hand-In</font></b>
</p><p>
Structure your project as a single sub-directory of the folder named
<b>Assign3MyASURITEID</b>.
The sub-directory should contain the <b>Android</b> app.
You will submit this project, by first cleaning it (to remove all generated files.
Then create a <b>jar</b> or <b>zip</b> archive of the project (Assign3*) directory.
You can create a <b>Java Archive (jar)</b> by executing the following command from
a terminal in the directory which is parent to the project directory:<br><br>
<b>jar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-cvf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assign3MyASURITEID.jar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assign3MyASURITEID/</b><br><br>
That archive will then be submitted via
<b>Blackboard</b>. See the Content section.
</p><p><b><font size="+1">Grading Criteria</font></b>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
  <li><b>5 points</b>. Your solution builds using Android Studio. And, your
  UI appears properly in the Android emulator with a <b>Nexus5-API23</b>.
  </li>
  <li><b>5 points</b>. Your Android app should define and properly use <b>all</b>
  of the controls discussed above in the section on <b>Constraints</b>.
  </li>
  <li><b>5 points</b>. Your solution includes comments described above as headers for each
  class used in the apps.
  </li><li><b>5 points</b>. Your app provides the ability to list all place names, to display
  the details of a single place, and to manually add or remove place descriptions.
  </li>
