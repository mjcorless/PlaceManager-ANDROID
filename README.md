The goal is to develop a multi-View Android app, which allows the user to manipulate (browse, view details, add, delete, and modify) geographic place descriptions. The app should use a SQLite database as its underlying model. The database should have an initial set of places which are a part of the app bundle (installation file). The app should also allow the user to select two of the registered places and to view the great circle distance and initial heading between the two selected places.
